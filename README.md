# Survey App

## What I did

- Reviewed assignment as if it were a product brief
- Outlined the screens/pages that would be needed
- Spun up a fresh create-react-app
- Added in `react-hook-form` and `react-bootstrap`
- Created the form components and made sure the data was coming through in a way that would support displaying it in the summary
- Added form components into larger components that would make up each screen of the survey and got the survey working without being in a modal
- Put the survey into a modal first working with a show/hide button
- Removed the show/hide button in favor of setTimeout in a useEffect

## With more time

- Figure out more about how to package the build more neatly/do it better (this is the first time I've tried this)
- create more reusable components to simplify the individual screens, ex. reusable `react-hook-form` components rather than the more verbose way that they're used here
- Better styling, minimal styling of individual components unless absolutely necessary
- Add in a few tests for functional logic

## What did I learn from this

- how to use build files to inject a react application into a basic webpage

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
